> **Key Updates:** Version 0.3.0 introduces multi-dimensional random walks (up to 3D), subset functionality for targeting specific y-values, and confidence interval calculations for enhanced statistical analysis. This major update significantly expands RandomWalker's capabilities for R programmers working with stochastic processes.

# Introduction: Taking Random Walks to New Dimensions

The RandomWalker package for R has been a valuable tool for generating and analyzing random walks compatible with the tidyverse ecosystem. Version 0.3.0 brings three major enhancements that significantly expand its capabilities: multi-dimensional random walks (up to three dimensions), a new subset function for filtering walks based on y-values, and a confidence interval function for statistical analysis. This update addresses several user requests while maintaining the package's commitment to simplicity and integration with the tidyverse workflow.

If you're working with stochastic processes, time series analysis, or simulation in R, these new features offer powerful new options for your analytical toolkit. Let's explore what's new and how to leverage these enhancements in your projects.

# Breaking Change Alert

Before jumping into the new features, there's an important **breaking change** to note: the `x` column in the output data frames has been renamed to `step_number`. This change provides more clarity about what the column represents, but it will require updates to existing code that references the `x` column if you have the. We'll provide migration guidance later in this article.

# New Feature #1: Multi-Dimensional Random Walks

## What Are Multi-Dimensional Random Walks?

Random walks are mathematical models describing paths consisting of random steps. Previously, RandomWalker was limited to one-dimensional walks, where each step moved only forward or backward along a single axis.

With version 0.3.0, you can now generate random walks in up to three dimensions, allowing for more complex and realistic simulations. This enhancement opens up new possibilities for modeling phenomena in physics (like particle movement), finance (multi-asset price movements), biology (animal movement patterns), and many other fields.

## Technical Implementation

The multi-dimensional random walks feature was implemented through Fix 107, which served as the parent task for related fixes (108, 109, 110, 111, and 112). The implementation allows users to specify the number of dimensions (1, 2, or 3) when generating a random walk.

## Example Usage

Let's look at how to generate multi-dimensional random walks using the new functionality:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the RandomWalker package
library(RandomWalker)
library(dplyr)

# Generate a 1D random walk (same as before)
walk_1d <- random_normal_walk(.dimensions = 1, .n = 100)

# Generate a 2D random walk
walk_2d <- random_normal_walk(.dimensions = 2, .n = 100)

# Generate a 3D random walk
walk_3d <- random_normal_walk(.dimensions = 3, .n = 100)

# Preview the structure of each walk
glimpse(walk_1d)
glimpse(walk_2d)
glimpse(walk_3d)
```

The output data frame for multi-dimensional walks includes columns for each dimension (`x`, `y`, `z`), along with the `step_number` and `walk_number` columns.

## Visualization of 2D and 3D Random Walks

Random walks are best understood visually. Here's a comparison of 2D and 3D random walks:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

rw30() |>
  filter(walk_number == 1) |>
  visualize_walks()

# Generate a 2D random walk
n <- 1000
random_walk <- random_normal_walk(
  .dimensions = 2, 
  .n = n, 
  .num_walks = 1
  )

random_walk |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cum_sum_x, y = cum_sum_y)) +
  geom_path(aes(color = step_number)) +
  geom_point(data = random_walk[c(1, n), ], 
             aes(color = step_number), 
             size = 3) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  labs(title = "2D Random Walk",
       x = "X Position",
       y = "Y Position") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), #remove x axis labels
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(), #remove x axis ticks
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),  #remove y axis labels
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()  #remove y axis ticks
  )

random_walk_3d <- random_normal_walk(
  .dimensions = 3, 
  .n = n, 
  .num_walks = 1
)

plot_ly(
  data = random_walk_3d,
  x = ~cum_sum_x,
  y = ~cum_sum_y,
  z = ~cum_sum_z,
  type = "scatter3d",
  mode = 'lines',
  opacity = 1, line = list(width = 1, color='steelblue', reverscale = FALSE)
)
```

The first plot shows a 1D random walk with th Y values plotted over step_number, while the second the X-Y projection of a 2D random walk. Notice how the 2D walk creates more complex patterns as it moves through two-dimensional space. Lastly the third plot shows a 3D random walk, which adds depth to the visualization. The 3D plot allows you to see how the walk moves through three-dimensional space, providing a more comprehensive view of the random walk's path.

# New Feature #2: Subset Walks Function

## Purpose and Functionality

The new `subset_walks` function allows you to filter random walks based on maximum or minimum y-values. This feature in it's current state will grab the walk that has either the highest or lowest y value. This can be useful if you only want to see the maximum ending value.

Fix 105 introduced this functionality in response to user requests for more targeted analysis capabilities.

## Example Usage

Here's how you can use the new `subset_walks` function:

```{r}
# Generate a random walk
walk <- rw30()

# Subset the walk to include only steps where y is between -10 and 10
subset_walks(walk, .type = "min") |> visualize_walks()
subset_walks(walk, .type = "max") |> visualize_walks()
subset_walks(walk, .type = "both") |> visualize_walks()
```

The function returns a new data frame containing only the walk with either the max or minimum y value.

# New Feature #3: Confidence Interval Function

## Understanding Confidence Intervals for Random Walks

Confidence intervals provide a range of values that are likely to contain the true value of an unknown parameter with a specified level of confidence. In the context of random walks, confidence intervals can help quantify the uncertainty in the walk's path and provide statistical bounds for analysis.

Fix 142 introduced the `confidence_interval` function, allowing users to calculate these statistical boundaries for their random walks.

## Example Usage

Here's how to use the new `confidence_interval` function:

```{r}
# Generate a random walk
walk <- random_normal_walk(.n = 500, .num_walks = 1)

# Calculate 95% confidence interval for the y values
confidence_interval(walk$y, .interval = 0.95)
confidence_interval(walk$y, .interval = 0.99)
```

The function returns a tibble containing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval at the specified confidence level.

# Migration Guide: Updating Your Code for Version 0.3.0

## Breaking Change: From `x` to `step_number`

As mentioned earlier, version 0.3.0 introduces a breaking change: the `x` column in output data frames has been renamed to `step_number`. This change makes the column name more descriptive of what it actually represents (the step number in the walk), but it requires updating existing code that references the `x` column.

## Before and After Comparison

Let's compare the data structure and common operations before and after the update:

### Data Structure Before (pre 0.3.0):

```         
   walk_number  x  y
1            1  1 -1
2            1  2  0
3            1  3 -1
```

### Data Structure After (version 0.3.0+):

```         
   walk_number  step_number  y
1            1            1 -1
2            1            2  0
3            1            3 -1
```

## Code Migration Examples

Here are some common code patterns and how to update them:

### 1. Plotting:

``` r
# Old code
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line()

# New code
ggplot(data, aes(x = step_number, y = y)) + geom_line()
```

### 2. Summarizing by steps:

``` r
# Old code
group_by(x) %>% summarize(mean_y = mean(y))

# New code
group_by(step_number) %>% summarize(mean_y = mean(y))
```

### 3. Filtering specific steps:

``` r
# Old code
filter(x >= 10 & x <= 20)

# New code
filter(step_number >= 10 & step_number <= 20)
```

## Quick Migration Script

If you have many scripts that need updating, consider using this find-and-replace approach **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**:

``` r
# Find all scripts in a directory that use RandomWalker
scripts <- list.files(path = "your_scripts_directory", pattern = "*.R", full.names = TRUE)

# For each script, replace 'x' column references with 'step_number'
for (script in scripts) {
  content <- readLines(script)
  updated_content <- gsub("\\bx\\b", "step_number", content)
  writeLines(updated_content, script)
  cat("Updated:", script, "\n")
}
```

**Note:** This is a simplified example and may need adjustment based on your specific code patterns. Always back up your scripts before applying automated changes.

       x = "X Position", y = "Y Position") +
  theme_minimal()
```
