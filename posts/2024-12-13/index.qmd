# Introduction

Storage media management is a fundamental aspect of working with Linux systems. Whether you're a new Linux user or looking to expand your knowledge, understanding how to work with different storage devices is essential. This guide will walk you through the basics of storage media management in Linux, from mounting devices to creating file systems.

# Types of Storage Media in Linux

## Physical Storage Devices

- Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
- Solid State Drives (SSDs)
- USB Flash Drives
- CD/DVD Media
- Floppy Disks (legacy systems)

## Network Storage

- Network File System (NFS)
- Samba Shares
- Network-Attached Storage (NAS)

## Virtual Storage

- RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
- LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
- Virtual Disk Images

# Essential Storage Commands

## 1. mount and umount

The `mount` command attaches storage devices to your file system, while `umount` safely detaches them.

```bash
# Mount a USB drive
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

# Unmount a device
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
```

## 2. fsck (File System Check)

Use `fsck` to check and repair file system errors:

```bash
# Check file system integrity
sudo fsck /dev/sdb1

# Force check on next reboot
sudo touch /forcefsck
```

## 3. fdisk (Partition Management)

`fdisk` is used for creating, deleting, and managing partitions:

```bash
# Start fdisk for a device
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

# Common commands:
# p - print partition table
# n - create new partition
# d - delete partition
# w - write changes
```

## 4. mkfs (Create File Systems)
Create new file systems using `mkfs`:

```bash
# Create ext4 filesystem
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1

# Create FAT32 filesystem
sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1
```

# Working with Different Storage Types

## USB Flash Drives

1. Insert the drive
2. Identify the device name: `lsblk`
3. Create mount point: `sudo mkdir /mnt/usb`
4. Mount: `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb`

## Optical Media (CD/DVD)

```bash
# Mount CD/DVD
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom

# Create ISO image
dd if=/dev/cdrom of=backup.iso
```

## Network Storage
```bash
# Mount NFS share
sudo mount -t nfs server:/share /mnt/nfs

# Mount Samba share
sudo mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt/samba
```

# Your Turn! Practical Exercise

**Problem**: Create a new partition and format it with ext4.

**Steps**:

1. Identify your device using `lsblk`
2. Create partition with `fdisk`
3. Format with ext4
4. Mount and verify

<details><summary>Need help?</summary>

**Solution**:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
# Use n for new partition
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data
df -h /mnt/data
```
</details>

# Quick Takeaways

- Always unmount devices before physical removal
- Regularly check file system integrity
- Back up important data
- Use appropriate file systems for your needs
- Document your storage configuration

# FAQs

1. **Q**: How do I safely remove a USB drive?
   **A**: Always use `umount` before physical removal to prevent data corruption.

2. **Q**: Why can't I mount my drive?
   **A**: Check permissions, ensure the mount point exists, and verify the file system type.

3. **Q**: How do I check disk space?
   **A**: Use `df -h` for mounted file systems and `du -h` for directory usage.

4. **Q**: Can Linux read NTFS drives?
   **A**: Yes, with the ntfs-3g driver installed.

5. **Q**: How do I repair a corrupted file system?
   **A**: Use `fsck` in recovery mode or from a live USB.

# Best Practices

1. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Check file systems periodically
   - Monitor disk health
   - Keep backups current

2. **Safety Measures**
   - Always unmount before removing devices
   - Use write protection when needed
   - Verify checksums for important data

3. **Performance Tips**
   - Choose appropriate file systems
   - Regular defragmentation (when needed)
   - Monitor disk space usage
