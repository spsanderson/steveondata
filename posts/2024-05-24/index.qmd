# Announcing the Latest Updates to the healthyR.data R Package

Hello everyone,

I’m excited to share the latest updates to the healthyR.data R package! This release brings new functionality and minor improvements, all aimed at making your data management tasks easier and more efficient. Here’s a breakdown of what’s new:

## New Functions

### `get_cms_meta_data()`
This new function is designed to retrieve metadata from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Whether you’re working on health research, policy analysis, or clinical studies, this function provides a straightforward way to access essential CMS data.

[Learn more about `get_cms_meta_data()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.data/reference/get_cms_meta_data.html)

Syntax:

```r
get_cms_meta_data(
  .title = NULL,
  .modified_date = NULL,
  .keyword = NULL,
  .identifier = NULL,
  .data_version = "current",
  .media_type = "all"
)
```

### `get_provider_meta_data()`
Similarly, the `get_provider_meta_data()` function allows you to fetch metadata related to healthcare providers. This can be particularly useful for projects that require comprehensive information about provider attributes and characteristics.

[Learn more about `get_provider_meta_data()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.data/reference/get_provider_meta_data.html)

Syntax:

```r
get_provider_meta_data(
  .identifier = NULL,
  .title = NULL,
  .description = NULL,
  .keyword = NULL,
  .issued = NULL,
  .modified = NULL,
  .released = NULL,
  .theme = NULL,
  .media_type = NULL
)
```

### `fetch_cms_data()` and `fetch_provider_data()`
We’ve also added `fetch_cms_data()` and `fetch_provider_data()`, two powerful functions for fetching actual data from CMS and healthcare providers, respectively. These functions are perfect for those who need to integrate large datasets into their workflows seamlessly.

[Learn more about `fetch_provider_data()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.data/reference/fetch_provider_data.html)

Syntax:

```r
fetch_cms_data(.data_link)
```

```r
fetch_provider_data(.data_link)
```

## Minor Fixes and Improvements

### Bug Fix in `current_hosp_data()`
We’ve addressed a bug related to directory file paths in the `current_hosp_data()` function. This fix ensures smoother operation and better reliability when managing hospital data.

## No Breaking Changes
I’m pleased to report that this update does not include any breaking changes. You can upgrade to the latest version without worrying about compatibility issues with your existing code.

# Conclusion

These enhancements to the healthyR.data package are all about providing more robust tools for healthcare data analysis. I hope these new functions and fixes will improve your workflows and make your data management tasks more efficient.

As always, I welcome your feedback and suggestions. Happy coding!
