# Introduction

When writing scripts in Linux, you'll often need your program to make decisions based on different conditions. While the `if` statement is one way to handle this, the `case` statement provides a cleaner, more readable alternative when dealing with multiple choices. It's especially useful for creating menu-driven programs or handling various command-line options.

The `case` statement is like a traffic director for your script - it examines a value and routes your program down different paths depending on what it finds. Let's dive in!

# Basic Syntax of the case Statement

Here's the fundamental structure of a `case` statement:

```bash
case word in
    pattern1) commands ;;
    pattern2) commands ;;
    *) default_commands ;;
esac
```

Let's break this down:

- `word` is the variable or value you want to test
- `pattern1`, `pattern2`, etc. are the patterns you're matching against
- `commands` are what you want to run when a match is found
- `*)` is the catch-all pattern (like an "else" statement)
- `;;` marks the end of each case option
- `esac` (that's "case" spelled backward) closes the statement

Think of it like a multiple-choice question: "If the value is X, do this; if it's Y, do that; otherwise, do something else."

# Simple Working Examples

Let's look at some practical examples you can try right away.

## Example 1: Simple Menu System

This is a classic use case for the `case` statement - creating a menu for users:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Please Select:
1. Display System Information
2. Display Disk Space
3. Display Home Space Utilization
0. Quit"
read -p "Enter selection [0-3] > "
case $REPLY in
    0) echo "Program terminated."
       exit ;;
    1) echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
       uptime ;;
    2) df -h ;;
    3) echo "Home Space Utilization"
       du -sh $HOME ;;
    *) echo "Invalid entry" >&2
       exit 1 ;;
esac
```

## How This Works:

1.  We display a menu with numbered options
2.  The `read -p` command asks for input with a prompt
3.  The `case` statement checks the value stored in `$REPLY` (the default variable for `read`)
4.  Based on what the user entered:

  - `0`: The program displays "Program terminated" and exits
  - `1`: Shows the hostname and uptime information
  - `2`: Displays disk space usage with `df -h` (human-readable format)
  - `3`: Shows home directory space usage
  - Any other input: Shows an error message and exits with error code 1

This is much cleaner than writing multiple `if/elif/else` statements!

## Example 2: Yes/No Response Handler

Here's a simple script that processes yes/no responses:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Do you want to continue? (y/n) > " answer
case $answer in
    [Yy]|[Yy][Ee][Ss]) 
        echo "Continuing..."
        ;;
    [Nn]|[Nn][Oo])
        echo "Stopping..."
        exit 0
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid response - please answer y or n"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
```

## How This Works:

1.  The script asks if the user wants to continue
2.  The `case` statement:

  -   Matches `y`, `Y`, `yes`, `YES`, etc. using pattern `[Yy]|[Yy][Ee][Ss]`
  -   Matches `n`, `N`, `no`, `NO`, etc. using pattern `[Nn]|[Nn][Oo]`
  -   For any other input, shows an error message

This example shows how to use pattern matching to accept multiple forms of the same answer.

## Example 3: File Type Handler

This script demonstrates how to perform actions based on file extensions:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="example.txt"
case $file in
    *.txt) echo "Text file" ;;
    *.jpg|*.png) echo "Image file" ;;
    *.sh) echo "Shell script" ;;
    *) echo "Unknown file type" ;;
esac
```

## How This Works:

1.  We define a variable `file` with the value "example.txt"
2.  The `case` statement checks the file name against different patterns:

  - `*.txt` matches files ending with .txt
  - `*.jpg|*.png` matches files ending with either .jpg or .png
  - `*.sh` matches shell scripts
  - `*` matches anything else

Try modifying the `file` variable to see different results!

# Pattern Matching Features

The `case` statement supports several pattern matching techniques:

1.  **Single character matches**: `'a)'` matches the character 'a'

2.  **Character classes**: `[[:alpha:]])` matches any alphabetic character

    ```bash
    char="a"
    case $char in
        [[:lower:]]) echo "Lowercase letter" ;;
        [[:upper:]]) echo "Uppercase letter" ;;
        [[:digit:]]) echo "Digit" ;;
        *) echo "Other character" ;;
    esac
    ```

3.  **Multiple patterns using \|**: `'a|A)'` matches either 'a' or 'A'

4.  **Wildcard matching**: `'*.txt)'` matches any string ending with .txt

5.  **Day of Week Example**: Group similar cases together

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Get current day of week (1-7, 1 is Monday)
    day=$(date +%u)
    case $day in
        1)
            echo "It's Monday - Start of the work week!"
            ;;
        2|3|4)
            echo "It's a regular work day"
            ;;
        5)
            echo "It's Friday - Almost weekend!"
            ;;
        6|7)
            echo "It's the weekend!"
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid day number"
            ;;
    esac
    ```

This example shows how to group cases (like treating Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday the same).

# Advanced Feature: Multiple Actions Per Match

In Bash 4.0 and newer, you can use `;;&` instead of `;;` to continue checking patterns even after a match:

```bash
case $char in
    [[:lower:]]) echo "Is lowercase" ;;&
    [[:alpha:]]) echo "Is alphabetic" ;;&
esac
```

If `$char` contains a lowercase letter, both messages will be displayed because the script continues checking patterns after the first match.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

When using `case` statements, watch out for these beginner pitfalls:

## 1. Forgetting the Catch-all Pattern

Always include a catch-all pattern (`*`) as the last case. Without it, unexpected input might not be handled properly:

```bash
# Bad example - no catch-all
case $choice in
    1) echo "Option 1" ;;
    2) echo "Option 2" ;;
esac

# Good example - with catch-all
case $choice in
    1) echo "Option 1" ;;
    2) echo "Option 2" ;;
    *) echo "Invalid option" ;;
esac
```

## 2. Not Quoting Variables

When using variables in scripts, always quote them to handle spaces and special characters properly:

```bash
# Bad example - unquoted variable
file=my file.txt  # This will cause an error!
case $file in   # Should be "$file"
    *.txt) echo "Text file" ;;
esac

# Good example - quoted variable
file="my file.txt"
case "$file" in
    *.txt) echo "Text file" ;;
    *) echo "Other file" ;;
esac
```

## 3. Forgetting ;;

Each case pattern must end with `;;` - forgetting this will cause syntax errors:

```bash
# Bad example - missing ;;
case $choice in
    1) echo "Option 1"    # Missing ;;
    2) echo "Option 2" ;;
esac

# Good example
case $choice in
    1) echo "Option 1" ;;
    2) echo "Option 2" ;;
esac
```

## 4. Mixing Up case Syntax With if Syntax

Remember that `case` has its own unique syntax different from `if` statements:

```bash
# Bad example - mixing syntaxes
case $choice in
    if $choice -eq 1; then  # Wrong! Don't use if inside case
        echo "Option 1"
    fi ;;
esac

# Good example
case $choice in
    1) echo "Option 1" ;;
esac
```

# Best Practices for Using case Statements

Follow these guidelines for clean, effective `case` statements:

1.  **Use for multiple choices**: When you have 3+ options, `case` is usually cleaner than `if/elif/else`

2.  **Add comments for complex patterns**: Explain what your patterns are matching

3.  **Include a catch-all pattern**: Always add `*)` as the last case

4.  **Group related patterns**: Use the `|` operator to group similar cases

5.  **Quote your variables**: Always use quotes around variables: `"$variable"`

6.  **Test your scripts**: Try different inputs to ensure your script handles all cases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Your Turn!

Let's practice! Try writing a simple script that takes a command-line argument and tells you whether it's a vowel, consonant, number, or something else.

Here's a starter template:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if an argument was provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Please provide a single character as an argument"
    exit 1
fi

# Get the first character of the first argument
char="${1:0:1}"

# YOUR case STATEMENT HERE
case ... in
    # Your patterns here
esac
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if an argument was provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Please provide a single character as an argument"
    exit 1
fi

# Get the first character of the first argument
char="${1:0:1}"

# Check the character type
case "$char" in
    [aeiouAEIOU]) 
        echo "'$char' is a vowel"
        ;;
    [bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ])
        echo "'$char' is a consonant"
        ;;
    [0-9])
        echo "'$char' is a number"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "'$char' is a special character"
        ;;
esac
```

Save this to a file (e.g., `charcheck.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x charcheck.sh`, and run it with a character argument: `./charcheck.sh a`

# Key Takeaways

- The `case` statement provides a clean way to handle multiple choice decisions in shell scripts
- It's more readable than multiple `if` statements for handling several conditions
- Basic syntax: `case variable in pattern) commands ;; esac`
- Always include a catch-all pattern (`*`) as the last case
- Use pattern matching features like wildcards (`*`), character classes (`[:alpha:]`), and pattern grouping (`|`)
- Quote your variables to avoid issues with spaces and special characters
- Test your scripts with various inputs to ensure they work correctly

# Conclusion

The `case` statement is an essential tool in your Linux scripting arsenal. By using it effectively, you can create cleaner, more readable scripts that handle multiple conditions elegantly. Whether you're building a menu system, processing command-line options, or categorizing data, the `case` statement offers a structured approach to decision-making in your scripts.

Remember that practice is key - try modifying the examples we've covered and create your own scripts to solidify your understanding. As you become more comfortable with `case` statements, you'll find they make your scripts more maintainable and easier to debug.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. When should I use a case statement instead of if/else?

Use a `case` statement when you need to check a single variable against multiple possible values. If you find yourself writing many `elif` statements checking the same variable, consider switching to `case`.

## 2. Can I use case with numbers?

Absolutely! You can match specific numbers or ranges. For example: `case $num in 1) ... ;; [2-5]) ... ;; esac`

## 3. How do I match multiple patterns in one case?

Use the pipe symbol (`|`) to match multiple patterns: `case $var in a|A|apple) ... ;; esac`

## 4. Can I use wildcards in case patterns?

Yes, you can use wildcards like `*` (matches anything) and `?` (matches any single character).

## 5. How do I make case statements case-insensitive?

You can either use pattern grouping like `[Yy][Ee][Ss]` to match "yes", "YES", "Yes", etc., or use the `shopt -s nocasematch` command before your case statement (but remember to reset it with `shopt -u nocasematch` after).
