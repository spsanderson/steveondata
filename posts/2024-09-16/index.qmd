# Introduction

Welcome to the world of 'RandomWalker', an innovative R package designed to simplify the creation of various types of random walks. Developed by myself and my co-author, Antti Rask, this package is in its experimental phase but promises to be a powerful tool for statisticians, data scientists, and financial analysts alike. With a focus on Tidyverse compatibility, 'RandomWalker' aims to integrate seamlessly into your data analysis workflows, offering both automatic and customizable random walk generation.

# Key Features of 'RandomWalker'

First let's install and load the package:

``` r
# Install the 'RandomWalker' package
devtools::install_github("spsanderson/RandomWalker")

# Load the 'RandomWalker' package
library(RandomWalker)
```

Or from CRAN:

```{r}
#install.packages("RandomWalker")

# Load the 'RandomWalker' package
library(RandomWalker)
```

## 1. Automatic Random Walks

-   **Function: `rw30()`**
    -   **Syntax:** `rw30()`

    -   **Examples:**

        ```{r}
        head(rw30())
        rw30() |> visualize_walks()
        ```

        This function generates 30 random walks, each consisting of 100 steps. Utilizing the normal distribution, users can specify the mean (mu) and standard deviation (sd) to tailor the walks to their needs. The output is a tibble in a long format, facilitating easy analysis and visualization.

## 2. Generator Functions for Custom Walks

-   **Function: `brownian_motion()`**
    -   **Syntax:**

        ``` r
        brownian_motion(
          .num_walks = 25,
          .n = 100,
          .delta_time = 1,
          .initial_value = 0,
          .return_tibble = TRUE
        )
        ```

    -   **Examples:**

        ```{r}
        head(brownian_motion())
        brownian_motion() |> visualize_walks()
        ```

        Simulate Brownian Motion, a continuous-time random process ideal for modeling phenomena such as stock prices and particle movement. The function allows for detailed customization, making it a versatile tool in probability theory and statistical analysis.
-   **Function: `geometric_brownian_motion()`**
    -   **Syntax:**

        ``` r
        geometric_brownian_motion(
          .num_walks = 25,
          .n = 100,
          .mu = 0,
          .sigma = 0.1,
          .initial_value = 100,
          .delta_time = 0.003,
          .return_tibble = TRUE
        )
        ```

    -   **Examples:**

        ```{r}
        head(geometric_brownian_motion())
        geometric_brownian_motion() |> visualize_walks()
        ```

        Widely used in finance, this function models the stochastic process of asset prices. It allows for the simulation and estimation of parameters, aiding in the analysis of financial assets and investment decision-making.
-   **Function: `discrete_walk()`**
    -   **Syntax:**

        ``` r
        discrete_walk(
          .num_walks = 25,
          .n = 100,
          .upper_bound = 1,
          .lower_bound = -1,
          .upper_probability = 0.5,
          .initial_value = 100
        )
        ```

    -   **Examples:**

        ```{r}
        head(discrete_walk())
        discrete_walk() |> visualize_walks()
        ```

        This function offers the ability to simulate discrete random walks with user-defined parameters such as the number of simulations, total time, and probability of upward movement. The results are comprehensive, providing insights into the cumulative sum, product, minimum, and maximum of the steps.
-   **Function: `random_normal_drift_walk()`**
    -   **Syntax:**

        ``` r
        random_normal_drift_walk(
          .num_walks = 25,
          .n = 100,
          .mu = 0,
          .sd = 1,
          .drift = 0.1,
          .initial_value = 0
        )
        ```

    -   **Examples:**

        ```{r}
        head(random_normal_drift_walk())
        random_normal_drift_walk() |> visualize_walks()

        ``` r
        random_normal_walk(
          .num_walks = 25,
          .n = 100,
          .mu = 0,
          .sd = 0.1,
          .initial_value = 0,
          .samp = TRUE,
          .replace = TRUE,
          .sample_size = 0.8
        )
