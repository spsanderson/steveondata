# Introduction

Understanding Linux permissions is crucial for anyone working with Linux systems. Whether you're a new system administrator, developer, or Linux enthusiast, mastering file permissions is essential for maintaining system security and proper file access control.

# Understanding Basic Permission Concepts

## User, Group, and Others

Linux implements a hierarchical permission system with three levels of access:

- **User (u)**: The file's owner
- **Group (g)**: Members of the file's assigned group
- **Others (o)**: Everyone else on the system

## Read, Write, and Execute Permissions

Each permission level has three basic rights:

- **Read (r)**: Value of 4
- **Write (w)**: Value of 2
- **Execute (x)**: Value of 1

```bash
# Example file permissions display
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 4096 Nov 1 2024 example.txt
```

## Numeric Permission Notation

Permissions can be represented numerically:

- 7 (rwx) = 4 + 2 + 1
- 6 (rw-) = 4 + 2
- 5 (r-x) = 4 + 1
- 4 (r--) = 4

# Essential Permission Commands

## The chmod Command

```bash
# Symbolic mode
chmod u+x script.sh    # Add execute permission for user
chmod g-w file.txt     # Remove write permission for group
chmod o=r document.pdf # Set others to read-only

# Numeric mode
chmod 755 script.sh    # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file.txt     # rw-r--r--
```

## Understanding umask

The umask command sets default permissions for new files and directories:

```bash
# Check current umask
umask

# Set new umask
umask 022  # Results in 755 for directories, 644 for files
```

## Working with su and sudo

```bash
# Switch to root user
su -

# Execute single command as root
sudo apt update

# Edit system file with sudo
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

## Managing Ownership with chown

```bash
# Change owner
chown user1 file.txt

# Change owner and group
chown user1:group1 file.txt

# Recursive ownership change
chown -R user1:group1 directory/
```

# Your Turn! Practical Exercise

Try this hands-on exercise:

**Problem**: Create a script that needs to be executable by the owner only, readable by the group, and inaccessible to others.

1. Create a new file:

```bash
touch script.sh
```

2. Your task: Set the appropriate permissions using chmod.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Create the file
touch script.sh

# Set permissions (owner: rwx, group: r--, others: ---)
chmod 740 script.sh

# Verify permissions
ls -l script.sh
```

# Quick Takeaways

- Permissions are divided into user, group, and others
- Basic permissions are read (4), write (2), and execute (1)
- chmod modifies permissions
- umask sets default permissions
- su and sudo provide elevated privileges
- chown changes file ownership

# Common Permission Scenarios

## Web Server Permissions

```bash
# Standard web directory permissions
chmod 755 /var/www/html
chmod 644 /var/www/html/*.html
```

## Shared Directories

```bash
# Create a shared directory
mkdir /shared
chmod 775 /shared
chown :developers /shared
```

# Troubleshooting

## Common Permission Issues

1. Permission Denied

```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -l problematic_file
# Check current user and groups
id
```

2. Cannot Execute Script

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x script.sh
```

# FAQs

1. **Q: Why can't I modify a file even as the owner?**
   A: Check if the file has write permissions for the owner using `ls -l`. Use `chmod u+w filename` to add write permissions.

2. **Q: What's the difference between su and sudo?**
   A: 'su' switches to another user account completely, while 'sudo' executes single commands with elevated privileges.

3. **Q: How do I recursively change permissions?**
   A: Use chmod with the -R flag: `chmod -R 755 directory/`

4. **Q: What's the safest permission for configuration files?**
   A: Usually 644 (rw-r--r--) or 640 (rw-r-----) depending on security requirements.

5. **Q: How do I check my current user and group memberships?**
   A: Use the `id` command to display all user and group information.
