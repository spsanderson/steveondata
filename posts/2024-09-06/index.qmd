# Introduction

I have mentioned in my previous linux post that I am on my own personal journey to learn it. I have been using it for sometime but not really understanding the commands. So I have started this blog post series on Linux for Friday's. This is the second post in the series. So thanks for joining!

# Navigation

Navigating the Linux filesystem is a fundamental skill for anyone working with Linux systems. The commands `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls` are essential tools for this task. This guide will provide an overview of these commands and how to use them effectively.

Linux systems use a hierarchical directory structure, similar to a tree, where the root directory is the base, and all other directories branch out from it. Navigating this structure efficiently is crucial for managing files and directories. Below are the key components of the Linux file system:

-   Root (/): The base of the Linux file system.
-   Directories and subdirectories: Used to organize files into logical groups.
-   Files: Actual data that resides in directories.

Understanding how to move through this file system is crucial for efficiently working in Linux. One important concept is the difference between absolute and relative paths:

-   Absolute path: A full path from the root directory (e.g., /home/user/documents).
-   Relative path: A path relative to the current directory (e.g., documents/ when already in /home/user).

# Understanding the `pwd` Command

The `pwd` (print working directory) command is used to display the full path of the current directory you are in. This is particularly useful when you are navigating deep into the directory structure and need to confirm your location.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/user_name
```

# Using the `cd` Command

The `cd` (change directory) command allows you to move between directories. By default, using `cd` without any arguments will return you to your home directory. You can navigate to a specific directory by providing its path:

-   **Absolute Path**: Starts from the root directory.

    ```bash
    $ cd /usr/bin
    ```

-   **Relative Path**: Based on your current directory.

    ```bash
    $ cd ../Documents
    ```

You can also use shortcuts like `~` to quickly navigate to your home directory or `..` to move up one directory level.

## Shortcuts

Here are some helpful shortcuts courtesy of ["The Linux Command Line"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593279523?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&ccs_id=ba5a2570-f67f-4d7d-814f-1d1420aeb9df) page 11 by William Shotts:

| Shortcut       | Result                                                                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| cd             | Changes the working directory to your home directory                  |
| cd -           | Changes the working directory to the previous working directory       |
| cd \~user_name | Changes the working directory to the home directory of **user_name**. |

# Exploring with the `ls` Command

The `ls` (list) command is used to display the contents of a directory. By default, it lists the files and directories in the current directory.

```bash
$ ls
Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures
```

Now with a little more information:

```bash
terminal@terminal-temple ~ $ ls -lh
total 5
drwxr-xr-x  5 terminal  staff  160 Mar 19 01:54 PM Documents
drwxr-xr-x  3 terminal  staff   96 Mar 19 01:54 PM Downloads
drwxr-xr-x  2 terminal  staff   64 Mar 19 01:54 PM Music
drwxr-xr-x  3 terminal  staff   96 Aug 23 07:16 AM my_new_directory
drwxr-xr-x  2 terminal  staff   64 Mar 19 01:54 PM Pictures
```

You can use various options with `ls` to modify its output, such as `-a` to include hidden files or `-l` for a detailed list.

# Practical Examples

Here are some practical examples to illustrate the use of these commands:

-   **Navigate to a Directory and List its Contents**:

    ``` bash
    $ cd /var/log
    $ pwd
    /var/log
    $ ls
    syslog  kern.log  auth.log
    ```

-   **Return to Home Directory**:

    ``` bash
    $ cd ~
    $ pwd
    /home/user_name
    ```

-   **Move Up One Directory Level**:

    ``` bash
    $ cd ..
    $ pwd
    /home
    ```

# Important Facts on Filenames

- Filenames that begin with a period (.) are hidden files. This means `ls` will not display them unless you use the `-a` option.
- Filenames are case-sensitive. For example, `file.txt` and `File.txt` are considered two different files.
- Filenames can contain spaces and punctuation, but it is generally recommended to avoid spaces in filenames to prevent issues with scripts and commands.
- Linux has no concept of a `file extension` like Windows. The file type is determined by the content of the file, not the extension. However, it is common practice to use extensions for certain file types (e.g., `.txt` for text files) as many applications do use the extension to determine the file type.

# Conclusion

Mastering the `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls` commands is essential for efficient navigation and management of the Linux filesystem. These commands provide the foundation for more advanced file system operations.
