# Introduction

Today, let's dive into a nifty R package called `taskscheduleR` that can automate running your R scripts. Whether you need to execute a task every hour or just once a day, `taskscheduleR` has you covered. This package leverages the Windows Task Scheduler, making it a breeze to schedule and automate repetitive tasks directly from R. Let's walk through a couple of examples from my new book, "Extending Excel with Python and R".

# Examples

## Example 1: Hourly Script Execution

First, let's set up a task that runs a script every hour. Here's the code:

```r
library(taskscheduleR)

# Create a task scheduler job that runs the script every hour
taskscheduler_create(
  taskname = "Hello World Hourly",
  rscript = "hello_world.R",
  schedule = "0 * * * *"
)
```

In this snippet, we use the `taskscheduler_create()` function to create a new task. Let's break down the arguments:

- `taskname`: A unique name for the task, in this case, "Hello World Hourly".
- `rscript`: The path to the R script you want to run, here it's "hello_world.R".
- `schedule`: This is the cron expression for scheduling. `0 * * * *` means the script will run at the start of every hour.

## Example 2: Daily Script Execution at a Specific Time

Now, let's set up a task that runs the script once a day at 10:00 AM. Here's how you can do it:

```r
# Create a task scheduler job that runs the script once a day at 10:00 AM
taskscheduler_create(
  taskname = "Hello World Daily",
  rscript = "hello_world.R",
  schedule = "0 10 * * *"
)
```

In this example, the `schedule` argument `0 10 * * *` ensures the script runs daily at 10:00 AM.

# Why Automate?

Scheduling routine tasks can save you a lot of time and reduce the chances of forgetting to run an important script. Whether it's updating a report, fetching data, or performing backups, automation ensures that these tasks run consistently and accurately without manual intervention.

# Give It a Try!

I encourage you to experiment with `taskscheduleR` and see how it can fit into your workflow. Whether you're new to automation or looking for ways to optimize your existing processes, this package offers a simple yet powerful solution.
