# Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of R programming, packages continually refine their capabilities to meet the growing demands of data analysts and researchers. Today, we're excited to announce the release of RandomWalker version 0.2.0, a minor update that brings significant enhancements to time series analysis and random walk simulations.

RandomWalker has been a go-to package for R users in finance, economics, and other fields dealing with time-dependent data. This latest release introduces new functions and improvements that promise to streamline workflows and provide deeper insights into time series data.

## Breaking Changes

Good news for existing users: RandomWalker 0.2.0 introduces no breaking changes. Your current scripts and analyses will continue to function as expected, allowing for a seamless upgrade experience.

## New Features Overview

Version 0.2.0 brings seven new functions to the RandomWalker toolkit, focusing on cumulative calculations and enhanced data manipulation. Let's explore each of these additions in detail.

## Detailed Look at New Functions

For all examples in this section, we'll use the following sample data frame:

```{r}
data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 2, 5, 4), y = c(10, 7, 6, 12, 5))
```

### 1. `std_cum_sum_augment()`

This function calculates the cumulative sum of a specified column in your data frame. It's particularly useful for analyzing trends in time series data.

**Example:**
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(RandomWalker)
result <- std_cum_sum_augment(data, .value = y)
print(result)
```

### 2. `std_cum_prod_augment()`

Calculate the cumulative product with this function. It's invaluable for scenarios involving compound growth or decay.

**Example:**

```{r}
result <- std_cum_prod_augment(data, .value = y)
print(result)
```

### 3. `std_cum_min_augment()`

This function computes the cumulative minimum, helping identify lower bounds or worst-case scenarios in your data.

**Example:**

```{r}
result <- std_cum_min_augment(data, .value = y)
print(result)
```

### 4. `std_cum_max_augment()`

Complementing the previous function, `std_cum_max_augment()` calculates the cumulative maximum, useful for tracking peak values or best-case scenarios.

**Example:**

```{r}
result <- std_cum_max_augment(data, .value = y)
print(result)
```

### 5. `std_cum_mean_augment()`

This function provides the cumulative mean, offering insights into the evolving average of your time series.

**Example:**

```{r}
result <- std_cum_mean_augment(data, .value = y)
print(result)
```

### 6. `get_attributes()`

`get_attributes()` allows you to retrieve attributes of an object without including the `row.names` attribute, streamlining data manipulation tasks.

**Example:**

```{r}
attr(data, "custom") <- "example"
result <- get_attributes(data)
print(result)
```

### 7. `running_quantile()`

This powerful function calculates the running quantile of a given vector, essential for understanding the distribution of your data over time.

**Example:**

```{r}
result <- running_quantile(.x = data$y, .probs = 0.75, .window = 2)
print(result)
```

## Minor Improvements and Fixes

### Enhancements to `visualize_walks()`

1. **`.interactive` parameter**: This new parameter allows for the creation of interactive plots, enhancing the user's ability to explore and analyze random walks visually.

2. **`.pluck` parameter**: With this addition, users can now easily extract specific graphs of walks, providing more flexibility in visualization and reporting.

**Example:**

```{r}
walks <- random_normal_walk(.initial_value = 10000)
visualize_walks(walks, .interactive = TRUE, .pluck = 2)
```

## Impact on R Users and Finance Professionals

These updates significantly benefit R users, particularly those working in finance and time series analysis. The new cumulative functions provide powerful tools for tracking trends, identifying patterns, and analyzing risk. The interactive plotting capabilities enhance data exploration and presentation, while the `running_quantile()` function offers valuable insights into data distribution over time.

For finance professionals, these tools can be applied to various scenarios such as:
- Analyzing stock price movements
- Assessing portfolio performance
- Evaluating risk metrics
- Forecasting financial trends

## Your Turn!

Let's put these new functions to use with a practical example. Try to calculate and visualize the cumulative sum and maximum of our sample data:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Problem: Calculate and plot the cumulative sum and maximum of the 'y' column in our data frame

# Your code here

# Solution:
library(RandomWalker)
library(ggplot2)

# Our data
data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 2, 5, 4), y = c(10, 7, 6, 12, 5))

# Calculate cumulative sum and max
cum_sum <- std_cum_sum_augment(data, .value = y)
cum_max <- std_cum_max_augment(data, .value = y)

# Combine data
df <- data.frame(
  step = 1:5, 
  original = data$y, 
  cum_sum = cum_sum$cum_sum_y, 
  cum_max = cum_max$cum_max_y
  )

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = step)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = original, color = "Original Data")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cum_sum, color = "Cumulative Sum")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cum_max, color = "Cumulative Max")) +
  labs(title = "Data Analysis", y = "Value", color = "Metric") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This example demonstrates how to use the new cumulative functions with our sample data frame, providing a practical application of the RandomWalker 0.2.0 features.
