# Introduction

Data manipulation is a crucial skill in R programming, and subsetting data frames is one of the most common operations you'll perform. This comprehensive guide will walk you through four powerful methods to subset data frames in R, complete with practical examples and best practices.

# Understanding Data Frame Subsetting in R

Before diving into specific methods, it's essential to understand what subsetting means. Subsetting is the process of extracting specific portions of your data frame based on certain conditions. This could involve selecting:

- Specific rows
- Specific columns
- A combination of both
- Data that meets certain conditions

# Method 1: Base R Subsetting Using Square Brackets []

## Square Bracket Syntax

The most fundamental way to subset a data frame in R is using square brackets. The basic syntax is:

```r
df[rows, columns]
```

## Examples with Row and Column Selection

```{r}
# Create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35, 28, 32),
  salary = c(50000, 60000, 75000, 55000, 65000)
)

# Select first three rows
first_three <- df[1:3, ]
print(first_three)

# Select specific columns
names_ages <- df[, c("name", "age")]
print(names_ages)

# Select rows based on condition
high_salary <- df[df$salary > 60000, ]
print(high_salary)
```

## Advanced Filtering with Logical Operators

```{r}
# Multiple conditions
result <- df[df$age > 30 & df$salary > 60000, ]
print(result)

# OR conditions
result <- df[df$name == "Alice" | df$name == "Bob", ]
print(result)
```

# Method 2: Using the subset() Function

## Basic subset() Syntax

The subset() function provides a more readable alternative to square brackets:

```r
subset(data, subset = condition, select = columns)
```

## Complex Conditions with subset()

```{r}
# Filter by age and select specific columns
result <- subset(df, 
                age > 30, 
                select = c(name, salary))
print(result)

# Multiple conditions
result <- subset(df, 
                age > 25 & salary < 70000,
                select = -id)  # exclude id column
print(result)
```

# Method 3: Modern Subsetting with dplyr

## Using filter() Function

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# Basic filtering
high_earners <- df %>%
  filter(salary > 60000)
print(high_earners)

# Multiple conditions
experienced_high_earners <- df %>%
  filter(age > 30, salary > 60000)
print(experienced_high_earners)
```

## Using select() Function

```{r}
# Select specific columns
names_ages <- df %>%
  select(name, age)
print(names_ages)

# Select columns by pattern
salary_related <- df %>%
  select(contains("salary"))
print(salary_related)
```

## Combining Operations

```{r}
final_dataset <- df %>%
  filter(age > 30) %>%
  select(name, salary) %>%
  arrange(desc(salary))
print(final_dataset)
```

# Method 4: Fast Subsetting with data.table

## data.table Syntax

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
dt <- as.data.table(df)

# Basic subsetting
result <- dt[age > 30]
print(result)

# Complex filtering
result <- dt[age > 30 & salary > 60000, .(name, salary)]
print(result)
```

# Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

1. Always check the structure of your result with `str()`
2. Be careful with column names containing spaces
3. Use appropriate data types for filtering conditions
4. Consider performance for large datasets
5. Maintain code readability

# Your Turn! Practice Exercise

Problem: Create a data frame with employee information and perform the following operations:

1. Filter employees aged over 25
2. Select only name and salary columns
3. Sort by salary in descending order

Try solving this yourself before looking at the solution below!

<details><summary>Click to Reveal Solution</summary>
Solution:

```r
# Create sample data
employees <- data.frame(
  name = c("John", "Sarah", "Mike", "Lisa"),
  age = c(24, 28, 32, 26),
  salary = c(45000, 55000, 65000, 50000)
)

# Using dplyr
library(dplyr)
result <- employees %>%
  filter(age > 25) %>%
  select(name, salary) %>%
  arrange(desc(salary))

# Using base R
result_base <- employees[employees$age > 25, c("name", "salary")]
result_base <- result_base[order(-result_base$salary), ]
```
</details>

# Quick Takeaways

- Base R subsetting is fundamental but can be verbose
- subset() function offers better readability
- dplyr provides intuitive and chainable operations
- data.table is optimal for large datasets
- Choose the method that best fits your needs and coding style

# FAQ Section

1. **Q: Which subsetting method is fastest?**

data.table is generally the fastest, especially for large datasets, followed by base R and dplyr.

2. **Q: Can I mix different subsetting methods?**

Yes, but it's recommended to stick to one style for consistency and readability.

3. **Q: Why does my subset return unexpected results?**

Common causes include incorrect data types, missing values (NA), or logical operator precedence issues.

4. **Q: How do I subset based on multiple columns?**

Use logical operators (&, |) to combine conditions across columns.

5. **Q: What's the difference between select() and filter()?**

filter() works on rows based on conditions, while select() chooses columns.
