# Introduction

Greetings, fellow data enthusiasts! Today, we're thrilled to unveil a fresh wave of functionalities in the ever-evolving TidyDensity package. Buckle up, as we delve into the realm of distribution statistics!

This update brings a bounty of new functions that streamline the process of extracting key parameters from various probability distributions. These functions adhere to the familiar naming convention `util_distribution_name_stats_tbl()`, making them easily discoverable within your R workflow.

Let's meet the newcomers:

*   `util_zero_truncated_negative_binomial_stats_tbl()`: Uncovers the secrets of the zero-truncated negative binomial distribution.
*   `util_zero_truncated_poisson_stats_tbl()`: Demystifies the zero-truncated Poisson distribution.
*   `util_zero_truncated_geometric_stats_tbl()`: Unveils the hidden characteristics of the zero-truncated geometric distribution.
*   `util_pareto1_stats_tbl()`:  Extracts the essence of the Pareto Type I distribution.
*   `util_paralogistic_stats_tbl()`:  Unlocks the mysteries of the paralogistic distribution.
*   `util_inverse_weibull_stats_tbl()`:  Illuminates the parameters of the inverse Weibull distribution.
*   `util_inverse_pareto_stats_tbl()`:  Provides insights into the inverse Pareto distribution.
*   `util_inverse_burr_stats_tbl()`:  Offers a glimpse into the world of the inverse Burr distribution.
*   `util_generalized_pareto_stats_tbl()`:  Simplifies extracting parameters from the generalized Pareto distribution.

Now, you might be wondering, "How do I put these new functions to use?" Fear not, for the answer is as easy as pie!

# Examples

Let's explore the zero-truncated binomial distribution. Suppose we're simulating the number of successes in 10 trials with a success probability of 0.1 (but hey, successes of zero aren't possible in this scenario!).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(TidyDensity)  # Assuming you've installed TidyDensity

set.seed(123)
tidy_zero_truncated_binomial(.size = 10, .prob = 0.1) |>
  util_zero_truncated_binomial_stats_tbl() |>
  glimpse()
```

This code snippet generates a dataset of zero-truncated binomial values and then utilizes the `util_zero_truncated_binomial_stats_tbl()` function to extract a summary table containing key parameters like the mean, variance, and quantiles. 

# Your Turn to Explore!

We encourage you to jump in and experiment with these new additions. Explore the documentation for each function (accessible through `?util_distribution_name_stats_tbl`) to discover their specific functionalities and supported distributions. 

With these new tools at your disposal, you'll be well-equipped to gain deeper insights into your data and unlock the power of various probability distributions in your R adventures!
