# Why Use Python for Email and SMS?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for automating tasks—including sending emails and text messages. With just a few lines of code, you can:

- Send notifications automatically
- Alert yourself about important events
- Build contact forms or customer support tools
- Save time by automating repetitive communication

# What You Need to Get Started

- **Python 3.x** installed on your computer
- A code editor (like VS Code, PyCharm, or even Notepad++)
- Internet access
- For emails: a Gmail (or other SMTP) account
- For SMS: a Twilio account (free trial available)

**Required Libraries:**
- `smtplib` (built-in for emails)
- `email` (built-in for formatting emails)
- `twilio` (install with `pip install twilio` for SMS)

# Sending Emails with Python (Step-by-Step)

## Understanding smtplib

`smtplib` is Python’s built-in library for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It lets you connect to email servers (like Gmail) and send messages programmatically.

## Setting Up Gmail SMTP

To send emails through Gmail:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** on your Google account.
2. **Create an App Password** (not your regular password) for your Python script.
3. Use these SMTP settings:
   - Server: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - Port: `587` (TLS)

## Your First Email Script

Here’s a simple script to send an email using Python and Gmail:

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

# Set up your email details
EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'your_email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_app_password'

msg = EmailMessage()
msg['Subject'] = 'Hello from Python!'
msg['From'] = EMAIL_ADDRESS
msg['To'] = 'recipient@example.com'
msg.set_content('This is a test email sent from Python!')

# Connect to Gmail SMTP server and send email
with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as smtp:
    smtp.starttls()  # Secure the connection
    smtp.login(EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD)
    smtp.send_message(msg)

print("Email sent successfully!")
```

> **Tip:** Never use your regular Gmail password in scripts. Always use an App Password for security.

## Sending HTML Emails and Attachments

Want to send a fancy HTML email or attach a file? Here’s how:

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'your_email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_app_password'

msg = EmailMessage()
msg['Subject'] = 'HTML Email with Attachment'
msg['From'] = EMAIL_ADDRESS
msg['To'] = 'recipient@example.com'
msg.set_content('This is a plain text fallback.')

# Add HTML content
msg.add_alternative("""
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color:blue;">Hello from Python!</h1>
    <p>This is an <b>HTML email</b> with an attachment.</p>
  </body>
</html>
""", subtype='html')

# Attach a file
with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as f:
    file_data = f.read()
    file_name = f.name
msg.add_attachment(file_data, maintype='application', subtype='pdf', filename=file_name)

with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as smtp:
    smtp.starttls()
    smtp.login(EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD)
    smtp.send_message(msg)

print("HTML email with attachment sent!")
```

## Validating Email Addresses

Before sending, it’s smart to check if the email address looks valid:

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$'
    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None

print(is_valid_email('test@example.com'))  # True
print(is_valid_email('not-an-email'))      # False
```

# Sending SMS with Python (Twilio)

## Getting Started with Twilio

1. **Sign up for a free Twilio account** at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/).
2. **Get your Account SID and Auth Token** from the Twilio Console.
3. **Buy a Twilio phone number** (free credits available for trial accounts).

## Twilio Python Integration

Install the Twilio library:

```bash
pip install twilio
```

## SMS Example Code

Here’s how to send a text message with Python and Twilio:

```python
from twilio.rest import Client

# Your Twilio credentials
account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

message = client.messages.create(
    body='Hello from Python SMS!',
    from_='+1234567890',  # Your Twilio number
    to='+0987654321'      # Recipient's phone number
)

print("SMS sent! Message SID:", message.sid)
```

## Automating Text Messages

You can use Python to send SMS alerts automatically—for example, when a script finishes running or an error occurs. Just wrap the SMS code in a function and call it when needed!

# Error Handling & Troubleshooting

- **SMTP Connection Refused:** Double-check your SMTP server, port, and internet connection. Make sure your firewall isn’t blocking port 587.
- **Authentication Errors:** Use App Passwords for Gmail. For Twilio, make sure your Account SID and Auth Token are correct.
- **SMS Not Sending:** Check if your Twilio trial number is verified and you have enough credits.

# Security Best Practices

- **Never hard-code passwords or API keys** in your scripts. Use environment variables or a `.env` file.
- **Use App Passwords** for Gmail, not your main password.
- **Keep your credentials private**—never share them or upload them to public repositories.

# Practical Examples & Use Cases

- **Automated Email Alerts:** Get notified when a script finishes or an error occurs.
- **Order Confirmations:** Send customers a confirmation email or SMS after a purchase.
- **Contact Forms:** Automatically email or text yourself when someone fills out a form on your website.

# Your Turn!

Try sending an email and an SMS using the code above. As a challenge, modify the email script to send a message to multiple recipients at once.

```python
# Sending to multiple recipients
msg['To'] = ', '.join(['person1@example.com', 'person2@example.com'])
```

No! Sending emails with Python’s `smtplib` is free. SMS via Twilio is free with trial credits, but paid after that.

**2. Is it safe to use my Gmail password in Python scripts?**  
Never use your regular password. Always use an App Password for scripts.

**3. Why do I get 'connection refused' errors?**  
Check your SMTP server, port, and firewall settings. For Gmail, use `smtp.gmail.com:587` with TLS.

**4. Can I send SMS without Twilio?**  
Yes! Alternatives include TextBelt, MessageBird, and Nexmo.

**5. How many emails can I send per day with Python?**  
Gmail allows 500/day for regular accounts. Other providers have different limits.
