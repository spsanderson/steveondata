# Introduction

If you're an R programmer working with categorical data, you'll often need to measure the association between two binary variables. That's where **odds ratios** come in handy! The `epitools` package in R makes calculating odds ratios simple with its `oddsratio()` function .

In this guide, we'll walk through everything you need to know about calculating odds ratios in R. You'll learn the function syntax, see practical examples, and understand how to interpret the results. Whether you're analyzing medical data, conducting epidemiological research, or exploring any binary relationships, this tutorial has you covered.

# What Are Odds Ratios?

An **odds ratio (OR)** compares the odds of an event happening in one group versus another group. It's especially useful when you have two binary variables (yes/no, exposed/unexposed, success/failure) .

Here's what the values mean:

- **OR = 1**: No association between the variables
- **OR > 1**: Positive association (higher odds in the first group)
- **OR < 1**: Negative association (lower odds in the first group)

For example, if the odds ratio is 3.0, the odds of the outcome are 3 times higher in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group.

# Installing and Loading epitools

Before we dive into calculations, let's get the `epitools` package ready:

```{r}
# Install the package (only need to do this once)
#install.packages("epitools")

# Load the package
library(epitools)
```

# Understanding oddsratio() Syntax

The `oddsratio()` function has a straightforward syntax with several customizable options :

```r
oddsratio(x, y = NULL, 
          method = c("midp", "fisher", "wald", "small"), 
          conf.level = 0.95, 
          rev = c("neither", "rows", "columns", "both"), 
          correction = FALSE, 
          verbose = FALSE)
```

Let's break down each parameter:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **x** | A 2x2 matrix or table of counts | Required |
| **y** | Optional second vector (rarely used) | NULL |
| **method** | Estimation method | "midp" |
| **conf.level** | Confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for 95%) | 0.95 |
| **rev** | Reverse table orientation | "neither" |
| **correction** | Apply continuity correction | FALSE |
| **verbose** | Print detailed output | FALSE |

# Creating 2x2 Tables in R

Odds ratios work with 2x2 contingency tables. Here's how to create them :

## Method 1: Using matrix()

```{r}
# Create a 2x2 table
data <- matrix(c(30, 70, 10, 90), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# Add row and column names for clarity
rownames(data) <- c("Exposed", "Unexposed")
colnames(data) <- c("Disease", "No Disease")

# View the table
print(data)
```

## Method 2: Using a Data Frame

```{r}
# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  exposure = c(rep("Exposed", 100), rep("Unexposed", 100)),
  disease = c(rep("Yes", 30), rep("No", 70), 
              rep("Yes", 10), rep("No", 90))
)

# Convert to table
my_table <- table(df$exposure, df$disease)
print(my_table)
```

# Basic Examples with oddsratio()

Let's calculate odds ratios with real examples :

## Example 1: Simple Calculation

```{r}
# Create the data
data1 <- matrix(c(30, 70, 10, 90), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(data1) <- c("Exposed", "Unexposed")
colnames(data1) <- c("Disease", "No Disease")

# Calculate odds ratio
result <- oddsratio(data1, method = "wald")
print(result)
```

Based on our computation results, this would give us:

- **Odds Ratio**: 3.857
- **95% CI**: 1.767 to 8.422
- **p-value**: 0.0007

## Example 2: Different Method Options

```{r}
# Using Fisher's exact method
result_fisher <- oddsratio(data1, method = "fisher")
cat("Fisher's Exact Method Results:\n")
print(result_fisher)

# Using mid-p method (default)
result_midp <- oddsratio(data1, method = "midp")
cat("Mid-P Method Results:\n")
print(result_midp)

# Using small sample adjustment
result_small <- oddsratio(data1, method = "small")
cat("Small Sample Adjustment Results:\n")
print(result_small)
```

# Interpreting the Results

When you run `oddsratio()`, you get several key outputs :

| Output | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Odds Ratio** | The strength of association |
| **95% CI Lower** | Lower bound of confidence interval |
| **95% CI Upper** | Upper bound of confidence interval |
| **p-value** | Statistical significance test |

> **Key Takeaway**: If the confidence interval includes 1, the association is not statistically significant at your chosen confidence level.

# Real-World Examples

Let's look at some practical scenarios:

## Medical Study Example

```{r}
# Smoking and lung cancer data
smoking_data <- matrix(c(15, 25, 5, 35), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(smoking_data) <- c("Smokers", "Non-smokers")
colnames(smoking_data) <- c("Cancer", "No Cancer")

result <- oddsratio(smoking_data, method = "wald")
cat("Smoking and Lung Cancer Results:\n")
print(result)
```

From our calculations, this gives:

- **Odds Ratio**: 4.200
- **95% CI**: 1.350 to 13.065
- **p-value**: 0.011

This means smokers have 4.2 times higher odds of cancer compared to non-smokers.

## Small Sample Example

When dealing with small samples, use appropriate methods:

```{r}
# Sparse data
sparse_data <- matrix(c(2, 8, 1, 19), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
result_sparse <- oddsratio(sparse_data, method = "fisher")
cat("Sparse Data Results:\n")
print(result_sparse)
```

Results:

- **Odds Ratio**: 4.48
- **95% CI**: 0.206 to 293.962
- **p-value**: 0.251

Note the wide confidence interval due to small sample size!

# Visualizing Odds Ratios

Visual representations help communicate your findings. Here are the odds ratios from our examples:

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# Create a data frame for plotting
odds_data <- data.frame(
  Group = c("Exposed", "Unexposed", "Smokers", "Non-smokers"),
  Odds_Ratio = c(3.857, 1, 4.200, 1),
  Lower_CI = c(1.767, NA, 1.350, NA),
  Upper_CI = c(8.422, NA, 13.065, NA)
)
# Plot the odds ratios with confidence intervals
ggplot(odds_data, aes(x = Group, y = Odds_Ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Lower_CI, ymax = Upper_CI), width = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Odds Ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals",
       y = "Odds Ratio",
       x = "Group") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plot shows odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The dashed line at OR=1 represents no association.

Here's how the data looks in a contingency table:

```{r}
# Create a contingency table for visualization
contingency_table <- matrix(c(30, 70, 10, 90), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(contingency_table) <- c("Exposed", "Unexposed")
colnames(contingency_table) <- c("Disease", "No Disease")
# Display the contingency table
print(contingency_table)
```

# Common Use Cases

Odds ratios are widely used in:

1. **Case-Control Studies**: Comparing disease cases with healthy controls
2. **Clinical Trials**: Evaluating treatment effectiveness
3. **Epidemiology**: Identifying risk factors for diseases
4. **Cross-Sectional Studies**: Analyzing prevalence relationships
5. **Public Health**: Informing policy decisions

# Your Turn!

Try calculating an odds ratio yourself! Given this vaccination data:

|              | Got Flu | No Flu |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Vaccinated   | 10      | 90     |
| Unvaccinated | 30      | 70     |

**Challenge**: Calculate the odds ratio using the `oddsratio()` function. What does it tell you about vaccine effectiveness?

```{r}
# Create the table
vaccine_data <- matrix(c(10, 90, 30, 70), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(vaccine_data) <- c("Vaccinated", "Unvaccinated")
colnames(vaccine_data) <- c("Got Flu", "No Flu")

# Calculate odds ratio
library(epitools)
result <- oddsratio(vaccine_data, method = "wald")
print(result)

# The odds ratio should be approximately 0.259
# This means vaccinated people have about 74% lower odds of getting flu
# (1 - 0.259 = 0.741 or 74.1% reduction)
```
</details>

# Quick Takeaways

- **Odds ratios** measure association between two binary variables
- Use `epitools::oddsratio()` for easy calculation in R
- The function requires a 2x2 contingency table
- Choose the right method based on sample size:
  - Large samples: "wald"
  - Small samples: "fisher" or "midp"
- Always check confidence intervals for statistical significance
- OR > 1 means positive association, OR < 1 means negative association
- Wide confidence intervals indicate uncertainty (often due to small samples)

# Conclusion

Calculating **odds ratios in R** using the `epitools` package is straightforward once you understand the basics. The `oddsratio()` function provides a powerful tool for analyzing binary relationships in your data. 

Remember to:

- Structure your data as a 2x2 table
- Choose the appropriate estimation method
- Interpret both the odds ratio and its confidence interval
- Consider sample size when drawing conclusions

# FAQs

**Q1: What's the difference between odds ratio and risk ratio?**
A: Odds ratios compare odds (probability of event/probability of no event), while risk ratios compare probabilities directly. Odds ratios are preferred in case-control studies where risk cannot be directly calculated.

**Q2: When should I use Fisher's method instead of Wald?**
A: Use Fisher's method when you have small sample sizes (any cell count < 5) or sparse data. It provides exact p-values rather than approximations.

**Q3: How do I handle tables larger than 2x2?**
A: The `oddsratio()` function only works with 2x2 tables. For larger tables, you'll need to subset your data or use other functions like `epitab()` for more complex analyses.

**Q4: What does it mean if my confidence interval is very wide?**
A: A wide confidence interval indicates high uncertainty in your estimate, usually due to small sample sizes. Consider collecting more data or using methods designed for small samples.

**Q5: Can I use odds ratios for non-binary variables?**
A: No, odds ratios are specifically for binary (two-category) variables. For variables with more categories, consider other measures like relative risk ratios or multinomial logistic regression.
