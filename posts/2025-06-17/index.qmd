# Introduction

Random number generation is a common task when working with simulations or sampling data in R. In this article, we explain how the runif function creates random values that follow a uniform distribution. We present several code examples to illustrate basic usage and a deeper exploration of generating random numbers. The article is split into two main parts. The first part explains the base runif() function, while the second part introduces a TidyDensity function: tidy_uniform(), that outputs uniformly distributed numbers in a tibble format. This discussion will help R programmers at every level apply these tools in data analysis and simulation tasks .

# What Is a Uniform Distribution?

A uniform distribution is one where every value in a specified range is equally likely to occur. In R, the runif() function allows you to tap into this distribution by specifying the total number of samples, along with the lower and upper boundaries. For example, by default runif produces values between 0 and 1 when the boundary values are not provided. This even distribution of chance is useful in many statistical simulations and random sampling scenarios .

# Base R: Using the runif() Function

The base R runif() function is widely used to create random deviates that follow a uniform distribution. Its simple syntax is as follows:

```r
runif(n, min = 0, max = 1)
```

Here,

• `n` represents the number of random points to be generated,  
• `min` is the lower limit, and  
• `max` is the upper limit of the distribution .

Below are several examples that demonstrate how to use runif() in practice for various purposes.

## Example 1: Generating Ten Random Numbers

A straightforward application involves generating ten random numbers between 0 and 1. This is the default setting:

```{r}
# Generate 10 random numbers between 0 and 1
random_numbers <- runif(10)
print(random_numbers)
```

This code creates ten random values that are evenly spread over the [0, 1] interval. This is useful for simple simulations or random sampling tasks.

## Example 2: Customizing the Lower and Upper Limits

Sometimes you require random numbers within a different range. In the following example, we generate 15 random values between 5 and 10:

```{r}
# Generate 15 random numbers between 5 and 10
custom_numbers <- runif(15, min = 5, max = 10)
print(custom_numbers)
```

By creating a sample over the [5, 10] interval, the code can be applied when using measurement units or settings where the numbers do not naturally fall between 0 and 1 .

## Example 3: Creating a Large Sample and Plotting a Histogram

For simulation studies or visual analysis, generating a large sample can help in understanding the distribution. Use this example to create 1,000 random numbers and plot a histogram to visually inspect the even spread.

```{r}
# Generate 1,000 random numbers and plot the distribution
set.seed(123)  # ensure reproducibility
large_sample <- runif(1000, min = 0, max = 1)

# Plotting the histogram
hist(large_sample, main = "Histogram of 1000 Uniform Random Numbers", 
     xlab = "Value", col = "skyblue", border = "white")
```

The histogram should show an even distribution of numbers across the defined range. Visualizing the output reinforces understanding of the uniform nature of these values .

## Example 4: Using runif() Within a Simulation Function

In many simulation tasks, you may require a custom function that uses runif() to generate uniform deviates as part of a broader algorithm. The following code shows how to embed runif() within a simulation scenario:

```{r}
# Define a simulation function using runif()
simulate_uniform <- function(simulations, points) {
  results <- numeric(simulations)
  for (i in 1:simulations) {
    # Generate a sample of random numbers and compute the mean
    sample_values <- runif(points, min = 10, max = 20)
    results[i] <- mean(sample_values)
  }
  return(results)
}

# Run the simulation with 50 iterations; each iteration has 100 uniform random numbers
simulation_results <- simulate_uniform(50, 100)
print(simulation_results)
```

This function collects statistical summaries from repeated runs of random sampling. Such techniques are common in simulation-based inference or bootstrapping methods .

# Tidy runif: Using the TidyDensity Approach with tidy_uniform()

In addition to the classic runif() function in base R, the tidy ecosystem offers a cleaner, tibble based approach to random number generation. The function tidy_uniform(), part of a collection of functions for generating various probability distributions, produces outputs as a tibble. This makes it easier to integrate with other tidyverse tools for further processing and visualization.

The tidy_uniform() function generates n random points from a uniform distribution over specified minimum and maximum values. It returns a tibble that includes columns such as:

• `sim_number`: Current simulation number  
• `x`: The sample index  
• `y`: The generated random number  
• `dx` and `dy`: Values derived from density computations  
• `p` and `q`: Values from the probability and quantile functions, respectively

This added information can be useful when exploring the distribution in more depth.

## Example 1: Generating a Tibble of Uniform Random Numbers

The first example with tidy_uniform() illustrates a simple call that returns a tibble. The following code snippet demonstrates how to generate 50 random numbers:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(TidyDensity)
library(dplyr)
# Assuming tidy_uniform is available from your analysis package
# Generate a tibble with 50 random uniform values using tidy_uniform()
result_tbl <- tidy_uniform(.n = 50, .min = 0, .max = 1)
print(result_tbl)
```

The output is a tibble so this format makes it easier to integrate analyses across other tidy tools and pipelines.

## Example 2: Simulating Multiple Runs

Using tidy_uniform(), you can simulate several runs of random figures easily. Here is an example where we generate random numbers from 3 separate simulations:

```{r}
# Generate a tibble with 3 simulation runs; each simulation has 30 random numbers
multi_sim_tbl <- tidy_uniform(.n = 30, .min = 2, .max = 8, .num_sims = 3)
print(multi_sim_tbl)

util_uniform_stats_tbl(multi_sim_tbl) |>
  glimpse()
```

Each simulation run is identified by the sim_number column, allowing for easy grouping and comparing between the different simulation runs .

## Example 3: Plotting the Results with ggplot2

The tibble output from tidy_uniform() can be directly used with ggplot2 for a more detailed visual analysis of the generated data. The following example shows how to plot the density of these random numbers:

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Generate random uniform data using tidy_uniform()
data_tbl <- tidy_uniform(.n = 1000, .min = 0, .max = 1, .num_sims = 1)

# Plot the density of the random numbers
ggplot(data_tbl, aes(x = y)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), 
                 fill = "lightgreen", 
                 color = "black",
                 bins = 10) +
  geom_density(color = "darkgreen", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot of Uniform Random Numbers", 
    x = "Random Value", 
    y = "Density"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This graph provides a visual confirmation of the uniform distribution of the random outcomes and shows how tidy data structures are easily integrated into visualization workflows .

## Example 4: Combining tidy_uniform with Data Analysis Pipelines

For further statistical analysis, tidy_uniform() can be integrated with additional data processing steps. Consider the following example that computes summary statistics grouped by simulation number:

```{r}
# Assume tidy_uniform() has generated a tibble called simulation_data
simulation_data <- tidy_uniform(.n = 100, .min = 5, .max = 15, .num_sims = 5)

# Summarize the data by simulation number
summary_tbl <- simulation_data %>%
  group_by(sim_number) %>%
  summarise(mean_value = mean(y),
            min_value = min(y),
            max_value = max(y),
            median_value = median(y))

print(summary_tbl)

p <- c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95)
tidy_stat_tbl(simulation_data, y, quantile, "tibble", probs = p) |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = name,
    values_from = quantile
  )
```

This grouping and summarizing is a typical step in data analysis pipelines when leveraging the tidyverse. The output provides insights into how the generated values vary between different simulation runs .

# Interactive Section: Your Turn!

Now it is time for you to experiment with both approaches. Try the following exercise in your R console:

1. Use runif() to generate 20 random numbers between 100 and 200 and compute their standard deviation.
2. Use tidy_uniform() to create a tibble with 100 uniform random numbers between -5 and 5 over 2 simulation runs.
3. Plot histograms for both outputs and compare the visual results.
