# Introduction

For-loops are a cornerstone of R programming, allowing you to repeat actions for each element in a sequence or range. Whether you’re iterating over numbers, vectors, or data frames, understanding how to use ranges in for-loops is essential for data analysis, automation, and algorithm development.

This article will walk you through the essentials of for-loops with ranges in R, from simple counting to advanced applications, with clear, working code examples and practical tips.

# What is a For-Loop in R?

A **for-loop** in R is a control structure that repeats a block of code for each value in a sequence (range). It’s especially useful when you need to perform repetitive tasks, process data row by row, or apply custom logic that isn’t easily vectorized .

# Basic For-Loop Syntax

The general syntax is:

```r
for (variable in sequence) {
  # Code to execute
}
```

- `variable` takes each value from `sequence` in turn.
- The code inside the braces `{}` runs for each value.

# Creating Ranges: Colon Operator and seq()

## The Colon Operator (`:`)

The simplest way to create a range in R is with the colon operator:

```r
1:5   # Creates the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
10:1  # Creates the sequence 10, 9, 8, ..., 1
```

## The seq() Function

For more control (custom steps, decimals), use `seq()`:

```{r}
seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)    # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)               # 0.0, 0.1, ..., 1.0
seq_along(vector)                 # Indices for a vector
```

# Working Examples: From Simple to Advanced

## 1. Basic Counting with a For-Loop

```{r}
# Count from 1 to 10
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(paste("Count:", i))
}
```

## 2. Descending Ranges

```{r}
# Countdown from 10 to 1
for (i in 10:1) {
  print(paste("Countdown:", i))
}
```

## 3. Custom Step Sizes with seq()

```{r}
# Even numbers from 0 to 20
for (i in seq(0, 20, by = 2)) {
  print(paste("Even number:", i))
}
```

## 4. Decimal Sequences

```{r}
# Sine values for decimals between 0 and 1
for (x in seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)) {
  print(paste("sin(", round(x, 1), ") =", round(sin(x), 3)))
}
```

## 5. Iterating Over Vectors

### a. Direct Value Iteration

```{r}
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for (fruit in fruits) {
  print(paste("I like", fruit))
}
```

### b. Index-Based Iteration

```{r}
scores <- c(85, 92, 78)
for (i in seq_along(scores)) {
  print(paste("Score", i, "is", scores[i]))
}
```

## 6. Nested For-Loops

```{r}
# Multiplication table (1-3)
for (i in 1:3) {
  for (j in 1:3) {
    cat(sprintf("%d x %d = %d\n", i, j, i*j))
  }
}
```

## 7. Iterating Over Data Frames

```{r}
employees <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob"),
  age = c(25, 30)
)
for (i in 1:nrow(employees)) {
  print(paste(employees$name[i], "is", employees$age[i], "years old"))
}
```

## 8. Practical Application: Categorizing Data

```{r}
temps <- c(22, 18, 25, 30)
hot_days <- c()
for (i in seq_along(temps)) {
  if (temps[i] >= 25) {
    hot_days <- c(hot_days, i)
  }
}
print(paste("Hot days at positions:", paste(hot_days, collapse = ", ")))
```

## 9. Memory Pre-Allocation (Best Practice)

```{r}
n <- 10
squares <- numeric(n)
for (i in 1:n) {
  squares[i] <- i^2
}
print(squares)
```

## 10. Loop Control: break and next

```{r}
numbers <- c(1, 2, -1, 3, 0, 4)
sum_pos <- 0
for (num in numbers) {
  if (num < 0) next
  if (num == 0) break
  sum_pos <- sum_pos + num
}
print(sum_pos)
```

# Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

| Practice                | Do This                                 | Avoid This                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Use `seq_along()`       | `for (i in seq_along(vec))`             | `for (i in 1:length(vec))` (fails if empty) |
| Pre-allocate vectors    | `numeric(n)`                            | Growing vectors in loop   |
| Check range direction   | `1:10` or `10:1`                        | `1:0` (creates c(1,0))    |
| Use vectorization       | When possible, for speed                | Overusing for-loops       |

# Your Turn!
  
Write a for-loop that calculates the running average of a numeric vector.

```{r}
# Given vector
scores <- c(85, 92, 78, 96, 89, 94, 87, 91)
# Your code here
```

```{r}
running_avg <- numeric(length(scores))
for (i in 1:length(scores)) {
  running_avg[i] <- mean(scores[1:i])
  print(paste("Position", i, "- Running Average:", round(running_avg[i], 2)))
}
```
</details>

# Key Takeaways

- Use `:` for simple integer ranges, `seq()` for custom steps or decimals.
- Prefer `seq_along()` over `1:length()` for safe iteration.
- Pre-allocate vectors for better performance.
- Use `break` and `next` for flexible loop control.
- For-loops are great for custom logic; use vectorized functions when possible.

# FAQs

**Q1: When should I use `:` vs `seq()`?**  
A1: Use `:` for simple, consecutive integers. Use `seq()` for custom steps, decimals, or non-integer sequences.

**Q2: Can I change the loop variable inside the loop?**  
A2: You can, but it won’t affect the sequence of values the loop iterates over.

**Q3: What’s the difference between for-loops and apply functions?**  
A3: For-loops offer explicit control and are easier to debug; `apply` functions are concise and often faster for simple operations.

**Q4: How do I avoid errors with empty vectors?**  
A4: Use `seq_along()` or `seq_len()` instead of `1:length()` to handle empty vectors safely.

**Q5: What happens if I use `1:0` in a for-loop?**  
A5: It creates the sequence `c(1, 0)`, so the loop runs twice. Use `seq_len()` for zero-length safety.

# Conclusion

For-loops with ranges are a powerful tool in R, enabling you to automate repetitive tasks, process data, and implement custom logic. By mastering range creation, safe iteration, and best practices, you’ll write more robust and efficient R code. Practice with the examples above and integrate these techniques into your projects for better results.
