# Introduction

Hello! Today, we're going to discuss a common yet essential task in data manipulation: adding leading zeros to numbers. This might come in handy when dealing with IDs, ZIP codes, or any situation where a fixed-width numeric format is needed. We'll be exploring this using base R, keeping things simple and straightforward.

# Why Add Leading Zeros?

Sometimes, we need our numbers to have a specific format, especially when we're working with identifiers. For instance, ZIP codes in the US are typically five digits long. If you have a ZIP code like "123", you might want it to be displayed as "00123". Adding leading zeros ensures consistency in data presentation.

# The Base R Way

Let's break down the process step-by-step.

## Step 1: Converting Numbers to Strings

First, we need to convert our numbers to character strings. This is because leading zeros don't hold any significance in numeric form but are essential in string form.

```{r}
number <- 123
str_number <- as.character(number)
print(str_number)
```

## Step 2: Adding Leading Zeros

We can use the `sprintf()` function in base R to add leading zeros. The `sprintf()` function is powerful and versatile for string formatting.

```{r}
number <- 123
formatted_number <- sprintf("%05d", number)
print(formatted_number)
```

Here’s what’s happening:

-   `"%05d"` is the format specifier.
-   `%d` tells `sprintf()` that we're dealing with an integer.
-   `05` indicates that the output should be 5 characters wide, with leading zeros added if necessary.

## Step 3: Applying to a Vector

Often, you’ll be working with a vector of numbers. Let’s see how to apply this to each element in a vector.

```{r}
numbers <- c(1, 23, 456)
formatted_numbers <- sprintf("%05d", numbers)
print(formatted_numbers)
```

## Step 4: Dealing with Non-Numeric Input

It’s important to handle non-numeric input gracefully. You can use a combination of `ifelse()` and `is.na()` to manage this.

```{r}
mixed_input <- c(12, "abc", 345)
formatted_mixed_input <- ifelse(
  is.na(as.numeric(mixed_input)), 
  mixed_input, 
  sprintf("%05d", as.numeric(mixed_input))
  )
print(formatted_mixed_input)
```

# Conclusion

Adding leading zeros to numbers in R is simple with `sprintf()`. This method ensures your data looks consistent and meets the required format. Give it a try with your own data and see how it works for you.
