# Introduction

Hello, everyone!

I'm excited to introduce a new content series that will be shared across multiple platforms, including my blog, LinkedIn, Mastodon, and Telegram. This series is designed to provide you with valuable insights, practical tips, and deep dives into the tools and techniques I've developed and co-authored. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or someone looking to enhance your data manipulation skills, there will be something for everyone.

Here's what you can expect each week:

## **Monday: Introduction to a Package**

On Mondays, I'll introduce one of the packages I have written. These introductions will cover the package's purpose, its main features, and how it can help you in your data analysis and visualization tasks. Whether you're familiar with my work or new to it, these posts will provide a comprehensive overview of each package's capabilities.

## **Tuesday: An R Function**

Tuesdays will be dedicated to exploring a specific R function. I'll provide a detailed explanation of how the function works, its applications, and some examples to help you understand how to use it effectively in your projects. This will be a great way to expand your R programming skills and learn new techniques.

## **Wednesday: VBA and R**

On Wednesdays, we'll explore the integration of VBA and R. These posts will show you how to leverage the power of both tools to automate tasks, enhance your Excel capabilities, and streamline your workflows. If you're looking to bridge the gap between Excel and R, these sessions will be invaluable.

## **Thursday: Practical Example**

Thursdays will feature practical examples from the package introduced on Monday. I'll walk you through real-world scenarios and show you how to apply the package to solve specific problems. These examples will help you see the practical applications of the tools and give you ideas for your own projects.

## **Friday: Insights from "Extending Excel with Python and R"**

Finally, Fridays will be dedicated to insights and snippets from my book, co-authored with David Kun, titled "Extending Excel with Python and R." We'll cover various topics from the book, providing you with a sneak peek into its contents and practical tips for extending Excel's functionality using Python and R.

I am looking forward to sharing this journey with you and hearing your feedback. Make sure to follow along, and don't hesitate to ask questions or share your thoughts in the comments. Let's learn and grow together!

Stay tuned for the first post of this series coming next Monday!

Best regards,  
Steve
