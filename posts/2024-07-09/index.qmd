# Introduction

Hello, R users! Today, we'll dive into a common text manipulation task: extracting strings before a space. This is a handy trick for dealing with names, addresses, or any text data where you need to isolate the first part of a string.

We'll explore three approaches: using base R, `stringr`, and `stringi`. Each method offers its unique advantages, so you can choose the one that fits your style best.

# Examples

## Base R Approach

Let's start with base R. The `sub` function is a versatile tool for pattern matching and replacement. To extract the string before a space, we can use a regular expression.

```{r}
# Sample data
text <- c("John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Alice Johnson")

# Extract strings before the first space
first_part_base <- sub(" .*", "", text)

# Display the result
print(first_part_base)
```

In this example, the `sub` function replaces the space and everything after it with an empty string, effectively extracting the first part of each string.

## Using `stringr`

Next, let's see how `stringr` simplifies this task. The `stringr` package, part of the tidyverse, provides a consistent and easy-to-use interface for string manipulation.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load stringr package
library(stringr)

# Sample data
text <- c("John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Alice Johnson")

# Extract strings before the first space
first_part_stringr <- str_extract(text, "^[^ ]+")

# Display the result
print(first_part_stringr)
```

Here, `str_extract` is used with a regular expression to match and extract the part of the string before the first space. The `^[^ ]+` pattern matches the beginning of the string (`^`) followed by one or more characters that are not a space (`[^ ]+`).

## Using `stringi`

Finally, let's use `stringi`, a powerful package for advanced string operations. `stringi` functions are optimized for performance, making it a great choice for handling large datasets.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load stringi package
library(stringi)

# Sample data
text <- c("John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Alice Johnson")

# Extract strings before the first space
first_part_stringi <- stri_extract_first_regex(text, "^[^ ]+")

# Display the result
print(first_part_stringi)
```

With `stringi`, `stri_extract_first_regex` performs similarly to `str_extract` from `stringr`, using the same regular expression pattern.

# Conclusion

Each method—base R, `stringr`, and `stringi`—offers a straightforward way to extract strings before a space. Whether you prefer the simplicity of base R, the tidyverse consistency of `stringr`, or the performance optimization of `stringi`, you have powerful tools at your disposal.

I encourage you to try these examples on your own datasets. Text manipulation is a fundamental skill in data analysis, and mastering these techniques will enhance your ability to clean and prepare data for analysis.
