# Introduction

Greetings, fellow data enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the exciting world of tidyAML 0.0.4, where innovation meets efficiency in the realm of R programming. As we unpack the latest release, we'll explore the new features, enhancements, and the overall impact of this powerful tool on your data science endeavors.

# What's New in tidyAML 0.0.4?

## Introducing extract_regression_residuals()
One of the standout features in this release is the addition of `extract_regression_residuals()`. This function empowers users to delve deeper into regression models, providing a valuable tool for analyzing and understanding residuals. Whether you're fine-tuning your models or gaining insights into data patterns, this enhancement adds a crucial layer to your analytical arsenal.

## Enhanced Classification/Regression build with .drop_na
Responding to user feedback and aiming for seamless user experience, tidyAML 0.0.4 brings forth an important addition to `fast_classification()` and `fast_regression()`. The introduction of the `.drop_na` parameter allows users to handle missing data more efficiently, streamlining the classification and regression processes.

## Core Package Expansion
Acknowledging the diverse needs of data scientists, tidyAML now incorporates additional core packages. The inclusion of `discrim`, `mda`, `sda`, `sparsediscrim`, `liquidSVM`, `kernlab`, and `klaR` extends the scope of possibilities. These additions enhance the versatility of tidyAML, making it an even more comprehensive solution for your modeling requirements.

## Refined Internal Predictions
The update addresses #190 by refining the `internal_make_wflw_predictions()` function. Now, it includes all essential data elements: the actual data, training predictions, and testing predictions. This refinement ensures a more holistic view of your model's performance, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of its predictive capabilities.

# How Does tidyAML 0.0.4 Elevate Your Data Science Workflow?

## Streamlined Regression Analysis
With the introduction of `extract_regression_residuals()`, tidyAML empowers users to conduct in-depth regression analyses with ease. Uncover hidden patterns, identify outliers, and fine-tune your models for optimal performance.

## Improved Data Handling in Classification and Regression
The new `.drop_na` parameter in `fast_classification()` and `fast_regression()` simplifies the management of missing data. Enhance the robustness of your classification models by seamlessly handling missing values, resulting in more reliable and accurate predictions.

## Comprehensive Core Packages
The expansion of core packages broadens the toolkit at your disposal. Whether you're exploring discriminant analysis, support vector machines, or kernel methods, tidyAML now supports an extended range of algorithms, catering to diverse modeling needs.

## Holistic Model Evaluation
The refined `internal_make_wflw_predictions()` ensures that you have all the necessary components for a comprehensive model evaluation. Analyze the actual data alongside training and testing predictions, gaining a 360-degree view of your model's performance.

# How to Upgrade to tidyAML 0.0.4?
